ðŸ“š Machine Learning Journey with Python

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project documents my learning path in machine learning, from the basics to more advanced topics.
The aim is to provide well-organized, easy-to-understand code and explanations so that anyone interested in machine learning can learn along with me.

ðŸŒŸ Goals of This Repository
    To learn and implement machine learning concepts in Python.
    To write clean, well-documented, and beginner-friendly code.
    To create a helpful resource for others who want to learn machine learning from scratch.
ðŸš€ What You'll Find Here
Each section corresponds to a key step in the machine learning journey.

Module	Description
      1. Linear Regression	Implement linear regression from scratch and using libraries, with detailed explanations.
      2. Logistic Regression	Learn classification using logistic regression, focusing on concepts and practical coding.
      3. Data Preprocessing	Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
      4. Feature Engineering	Enhance model performance through feature selection and transformation.
      5. Model Evaluation	Techniques for evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
