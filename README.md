# ðŸ“š Machine Learning Journey with Python

Welcome to my **Machine Learning repository**! This project documents my learning path in machine learning, from the basics to more advanced topics. The aim is to provide well-organized, easy-to-understand code and explanations so that anyone interested in machine learning can learn along with me.

## ðŸŒŸ Goals of This Repository
- Learn and implement machine learning concepts in Python.
- Write clean, well-documented, and beginner-friendly code.
- Create a helpful resource for others who want to learn machine learning from scratch.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Find Here
Each section corresponds to a key step in the machine learning journey, categorized into **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning.

### ðŸ“Š Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to make predictions. Here are the key algorithms and topics I will explore:

| **Algorithm**                | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Linear Regression**      | Implement linear regression from scratch and using libraries, with detailed explanations. |
| **2. Logistic Regression**    | Learn classification using logistic regression, focusing on concepts and practical coding. |
| **3. Decision Trees**         | Explore decision trees for classification and regression tasks.                |
| **4. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** | Learn the concept of SVMs and how to apply them for classification problems. |
| **5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Implement the KNN algorithm for classification and regression.                |
| **6. Naive Bayes**            | Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks.                  |
| **7. Model Evaluation**       | Techniques for evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more. |

### ðŸ¤– Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in data without labeled responses. Below are the key unsupervised learning algorithms I'll cover:

| **Algorithm**                | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. K-Means Clustering**     | Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar data points.      |
| **2. Hierarchical Clustering**| Explore hierarchical clustering techniques for grouping data points based on similarity. |
| **3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** | Understand how DBSCAN can identify clusters and noise in data.               |
| **4. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** | Dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing and simplifying data.  |
| **5. Autoencoders**           | Learn how autoencoders can be used for unsupervised learning tasks, like anomaly detection. |

### ðŸ“‚ Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial to prepare data for machine learning models. Key topics include:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling (Normalization and Standardization)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and test sets
